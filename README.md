# ATP-Project-PartC
This is our maze project game, following the two parts of the algoritms of buliding and solving the maze.
In this part we focused on the GUI using JavaFX. We made a maze game of "Hashminia/ The Eight" theme (TV show). 
We aloud the user genetate his own maze size, and choose his solving algorithms. We also add an option of zoom, a hint for the next step, character chice, see a full solution and more.
The user can use the keyboard arrows, numlock numbers, and the mouse to move the character. In case of any error, we pop up an error message.
